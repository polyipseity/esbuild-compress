# CI Workflow: Build & Test
#
# This workflow runs build and test jobs using the pnpm package manager.
# It uses the `ubuntu-slim` runner to reduce GitHub Actions billing costs while
# maintaining compatibility with common Node.js workflows.
#
# Rationale: `ubuntu-slim` is chosen for its smaller image size, which speeds up
# job startup and reduces CI minutes billed. This is especially important for
# open source projects and small utilities.
#
# Jobs are named for clarity in the Actions UI. Each step is named for
# traceability and easy debugging.
